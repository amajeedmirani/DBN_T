# DBN-Tensorflow
Deep Belief Networks in Tensorflow.

# Models
This folder contains varios models that can be used in training.
All models are implemented using Tensorflow, so gpu can be used in order to speedup training.

* K-Nearest Neighbors in KNN.py (Tensorflow v 2.0b)
* Neural Netwok in NN.py (Tensorflow v 1.9, will be updated) 
* Neural Network in NN2.py (Current progress of implementation in TF 2.0b)
* Variational Autoencoder in VAE.py (Tensorflow 1.9, will be updated)

All models have the folowing interface:

* fit(X,[Y]) train model
* predict(X) returns classification based on actual training result
